Each social media placement (feed post, story, header) has a specific aspect ratio it's designed for. Matching this ratio is key to avoiding unwanted cropping."

To maintain control over your visual branding, it's best to create and optimize a separate image version for each platform, such as an Instagram post, a Twitter header, and a Facebook link preview."
